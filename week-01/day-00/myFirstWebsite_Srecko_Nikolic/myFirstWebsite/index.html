                <p>My two biggest passions are Computer Science and dancing. My day doesn't go by without those two.
                    Even if it just learning a new CS concept or a little dance break to the song on the radio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those two also complement each other. Creativity form dancing reflects on my creativity when writing code
                    and vice versa. Analytical skills from analyzing the code help me analyze choreography better and vice versa.
                    And someone would say that dancing and coding have nothing in common.
